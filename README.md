## About the Paper
**‚ÄúSurvey of Multilingual Reasoning in Language Models‚Äù**, provides the first in-depth review of multilingual reasoning in LMs. 
- systematic overview of existing methods that leverage LMs for multilingual reasoning, specifically outlining the challenges, motivations, and foundational aspects of applying language models to reason across diverse languages. 

- Overview of the standard data resources used for training multilingual reasoning in LMs and the evaluation benchmarks employed to assess their multilingual capabilities. 

- analyze various state-of-the-art methods and their performance on these benchmarks. 
- Explore future research opportunities to improve multilingual reasoning in LMs, focusing on enhancing their ability to handle diverse languages and complex reasoning tasks.

## Content of the Repository
This repository complements our survey paper, **‚ÄúSurvey of Multilingual Reasoning in Language Models‚Äù**. We identify four primary thrusts, viz. **Representation Alignment**, **Fine-tuning**, **Prompting**, and **Model Editing**, that collectively contribute to advancing multilingual reasoning in language models.
